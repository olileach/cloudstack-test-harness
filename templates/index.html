<p> <font size="3" color=#800000>This site provides automated cloudstack testing and uses the cloudstack 2.2.14 user API. Click on the test platform link to initiate a test.</font> </p>

<h2>The way the test works <p>
-----------------------------------------------------
</h2>

<p>You can select various test criteria by clicking checkboxes and where necessary selecting values from dropdrop boxes or input the data into text fields required to complete the test.

<p>For example, if you check the enable static NAT checkbox, you will be required to enter a FW port from, FW port to and the protocol to use for the static NAT.

<p>Once you have enetered your required test parameters correctly and have clicked on the submit button, you will be able to view the status of your test. 

<p>The test process is synchronous and your test results page will be updated as and when the test you have requested is completed.

<p>The test resources that have been created during the test will be deleted immediately after the test has completed, unless you have checked the checkbox to keep all resources created during the test. If you 

wish to keep your test resources, they will not get deleted and you will have to manually remove these resources by going in to the cloudstack UI, finding your 

resources created during the test and remove them

<h2> Current interface issues <p>
-----------------------------------------------------
</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you have not filled in the form correctly and you receive a validation error, some initally seleted checkboxes will be hidden by jquery. 
We need to unhide these checkboxes or reset the form to its default. Current work around is to uncheck and recheck the box to see test parameters again. Otherwise test parameters are actually 
still set as per the users initial selections.
<p>
<li>validation issue when select upload ISO. May need to reset page or unclick on uplaod ISO checkbox and recheck.
<p>
<li>Currently the choice of XenServer versions to test does not work. This piece of work has been designed but not implemented. Roughly 2-3 days of work.
</ul>
